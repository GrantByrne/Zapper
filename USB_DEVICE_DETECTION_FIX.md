# USB Device Detection Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced USB Device Filtering Logic
Modified `UsbRemoteHandler.cs` to support more flexible device filtering:
- Added support for `AllowAllHidDevices` configuration option
- Enhanced vendor ID checking with configurable additional vendors
- Added keyword-based filtering with configurable additional keywords
- Improved debug logging to show why devices are accepted or rejected

### 2. Configuration Support
Updated `UsbRemoteConfiguration.cs` with new settings:
- `AllowAllHidDevices`: When true, accepts any HID device (including keyboards)
- `AdditionalVendorIds`: List of additional vendor IDs to accept
- `AdditionalKeywords`: List of additional keywords to match in product names

### 3. Dependency Injection Fix
- Fixed service registration in `Program.cs` to use `AddUsbServices` extension method
- Added proper configuration binding for USB settings
- Fixed constructor to accept configuration via DI

### 4. Mock Handler Improvements
Enhanced `MockUsbRemoteHandler.cs` to simulate realistic devices:
- Added keyboard device simulations (Logitech K380, Apple Magic Keyboard, etc.)
- Fires device connection events on startup
- Simulates keyboard key presses in addition to remote buttons

## How to Test

### 1. Enable Real USB Detection
In `appsettings.Development.json`, set:
```json
{
  "USB": {
    "UseMockHandler": false,
    "EnableDebugLogging": true,
    "AllowAllHidDevices": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Test with Specific Keyboards Only
To allow only specific keyboards, use:
```json
{
  "USB": {
    "UseMockHandler": false,
    "EnableDebugLogging": true,
    "AllowAllHidDevices": false,
    "AdditionalKeywords": ["keyboard"],
    "AdditionalVendorIds": [1133]  // Logitech vendor ID (0x046D in decimal)
  }
}
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
With `EnableDebugLogging: true`, you'll see:
- Total number of HID devices found
- Which devices are accepted/rejected and why
- Device connection/disconnection events

### 4. Expected Behavior
When you disconnect and reconnect your USB keyboard:
1. The device should be detected (check logs)
2. A "RemoteConnected" event should fire
3. The UI should receive a notification (once notification UI is implemented)
4. The keyboard should appear in the list of available USB devices

## Next Steps

To complete the USB device notification feature:
1. Implement toast notifications in the Blazor UI for device connection/disconnection events
2. Add a USB device configuration page to map keyboard keys to remote functions
3. Consider adding a device whitelist/blacklist feature for better control
